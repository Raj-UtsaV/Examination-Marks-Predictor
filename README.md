## 📋 Project Overview

This project aims to predict student performance in **Mathematics** based on key factors such as:

- **Gender** 👦👧
- **Race or Ethnicity** 🌍
- **Parental Level of Education** 🎓
- **Lunch Type** 🍽️

## 📊 Model Overview

The machine learning model is trained using various features that influence student performance. The key steps include:

- **Data Preprocessing:** Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical values.

- **Model Training:** Train a regression model (e.g., Random Forest Regressor) using the processed data.

- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), R² Score, etc.

- **Prediction:** Make predictions based on the input data and display the result to the user.
