# 🧑‍🎓 Examination-Marks-Predictor 📊

This machine learning project predicts the **Math marks** of students based on various factors such as **Gender**, **Ethnicity**, **Parental Level of Education**, **Lunch Type**, **Test Preparation Course**, and individual **Reading** and **Writing Scores**. 

By using this model, we aim to understand how these factors impact students' academic performance in mathematics. 🎯

## 📋 Project Overview

This project aims to predict student performance in **Mathematics** based on key factors such as:

- **Gender** 👦👧
- **Race or Ethnicity** 🌍
- **Parental Level of Education** 🎓
- **Lunch Type** 🍽️
- **Test Preparation Course** 📚
- **Reading and Writing Scores** ✍️📖

By understanding how these variables affect a student's performance, we can provide insights for educational improvements.

## 🧑‍💻 Dataset Information

The dataset consists of the following columns:

- **gender**: The gender of the student (Male/Female) 👨‍🎓👩‍🎓
- **race/ethnicity**: The ethnicity group of the student (Group A, B, C, D, E) 🌎
- **parental level of education**: The highest level of education completed by the student’s parent (High School, Associate’s Degree, Bachelor’s Degree, Master’s Degree, Some College) 🎓
- **lunch**: Type of lunch the student received (Standard or Free/Reduced) 🍔🥗
- **test preparation course**: Whether the student completed the test preparation course (Completed or Not Completed) 📚
- **math_score**: The student's final score in Mathematics (target variable) ➗
- **reading_score**: The student's score in Reading 📖
- **writing_score**: The student's score in Writing ✍️

## 📊 Model Overview

The machine learning model is trained using various features that influence student performance. The key steps include:

- **Data Preprocessing:** Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical values.

- **Model Training:** Train a regression model (e.g., Random Forest Regressor) using the processed data.

- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), R² Score, etc.

- **Prediction:** Make predictions based on the input data and display the result to the user.
